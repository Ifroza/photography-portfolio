# Photography Portfolio
## Introduction
This is a fun **front-end web development** project that I tried building during one of my semester breaks. It is a portfolio project that consists of some of my clicked photos, some work in the field of photography as well as some achievements.
## Motivation
I wanted to get some hands-on experience in a coding project- this is the primary reason of taking on this task of building a website. I specifically chose a photography portfolio because *I love capturing moments*, I do so whenever I have the opportunity, and I thought this is the best way to showcase both my photography skills along with my tech skills.
